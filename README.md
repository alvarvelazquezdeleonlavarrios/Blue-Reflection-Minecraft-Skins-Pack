Welcome! This is an **Unofficial/Fan made** project about the magical girls RPG videogame franchise **Blue Reflection**.

The project contains skins of each character seen on the games and the anime TV show, which can be used as custom skins in Minecraft Java & Bedrock editions, according to the player’s body type: **Classic (Steve/4px)** and **Slim (Alex/3px) shapes**
