# Blue Reflection Minecraft Skins Pack

![BlueReflectionxMinecraft](src/img/logos/BlueReflectionxMinecraft.png)

Welcome! This is an **Unofficial/Fanmade** project about the magical girls RPG videogame franchise **Blue Reflection**.

This project contains the skins of each character seen on the games and the anime T.V. show, which can be used as custom skins for the player in Minecraft PC (Java & Bedrock) and Mobile (Pocket) editions (unfortunately, not supported in console versions).

Giving some context, in the games (and anime) there are students and *Reflectors*, magical girls who fight with the power of feelings. Therefore, this pack contains student and *reflector* skins.

In each link below, is mentioned the pack structure and its content organized in the following folders. Each one has custom skins for students and *reflectors* in their **classic (4px) and slim (3px) body** type respectively, so you don't need to edit the skins images if you want to change the body type (these are in PNG format).
